<ul>
<li>Easy to sync notes across multiple devices.</li>
<li>So fast compared to other alternatives.</li>
<li>Uses .md files. If something goes wrong with Obsidian, I would be able to switch to another app.</li>

<ul>
<li>It isn't open source.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If they close the app, you need to handle tags in a different app again. (You don't if you use markdown links.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>You are going to feel like somebody is reading your notes.</u>
<ul>
<li>I don't store sensitive information in Obsidian to solve this problem and I am not think about it so much which I don't want to waste my time on it. I couldn't find any open source alternative that is as good as Obsidian therefore I need to use it.</li>
<li>They say they don't, but how can we trust them if we don't know the source? Maybe reverse engineering, but I don't know how to do that, and I didn't find any information about Obsidian. Even if we do that and find out they don't read, we can't do that every time. That means they can change the code, and we need to reverse engineer continually to find out what is going on. Maybe closing the network for Obsidian can work, but that can be advanced to create a sandbox and close the network. Also, this would lead us to not be able to use extensions, which include a bunch of useful extensions.</li>

<ul>
<li>Publishing service is paid.</li>
<li>It's not like SiYuan's WYSIWYG editor. You can't create a dashboard and lack good-looking pages.</li>
<li>Exporting files to a folder hierarchy is experimental. If you switch from Dendron to another, you need to handle all the files via script (it probably takes a lot of time to achieve a good one) or manually (it's going to take a lot of time to do that, and I would probably choose a written script over doing that manually).<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>But you can access every markdown file.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For example: <code>webschool.linux</code>​​​ is for the <em>linux</em> markdown file, <code>webschool.linux.appinformation</code>​​​ is for the <em>appinformation</em> markdown file.</li>

<li>Only for premium users.</li>

<li>Revisiting notes would be faster.</li>
<li>Performance is much better than other applications.</li>
<li>It doesn't use an old-fashioned folder hierarchy.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This is the default behavior to create this note: <code>webschool.linux.appinformation.loqseqvssiyuanvsothers.md</code>​​, and there is no folder for webschool, linux, or any other categories. Just markdown files.</li>

<li>You need an account to sync with your other devices, and they will collect data whenever you use it.</li>
<li>There are so many things going on while using it. I mean, I can't try to learn hundreds of features from the beginning... It's like a never-ending cycle: you learn something, then need to learn something new, and often forget what you learned first, going back and forth.</li>
<li>I occasionally experience performance issues such as freezing and lag. I believe this occurs due to the heavy use of visual effects. It has a significant impact on the visuals.</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a student, I can say that I used to think piracy was the solution until I learned about open source and free alternatives (see <a href="https://alternativeto.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://alternativeto.net/</a>) and that pirated applications could contain viruses. Generally, hacker groups cracking applications in pirated software tend to avoid adding viruses so as not to tarnish their reputation.</p>
<p>However, the probability of viruses being added to pirated applications is quite high until they reach websites accessible to end users in Turkey. Therefore, you can incur much more damage by downloading pirated software than by paying for the legitimate version. In fact, some end users, despite lacking knowledge on these issues, may try to deceive you by claiming that pirated applications are free of viruses. Of course, the person adding the virus tries to prolong the time they can stay undetected by using the system minimally and not drawing attention to themselves.</p>
<h1>If you really need to use cracked software, than:</h1>
<p>Nevertheless, I cannot claim definitively that every pirated application contains a virus because sometimes such situations may not arise. Nonetheless, I do not recommend pirated software at all because the risk of virus infection is much higher than the possibility of it not happening. Additionally, if no other solutions can be found, using at least a virtualized system in an environment where internet connectivity is severed can be the most reliable method (see Qubes OS, VirtualBox).</p>]]></content>
